# Sonic the Hedgehog (2D)

Sonic the Hedgehog is a 1991 platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Genesis/Mega Drive. Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling platform game. 
The gameplay centers on Sonic the Hedgehog's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits and vertical loops.
The levels are populated with robot enemies, inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals; destroying a robot frees the animal. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents.
